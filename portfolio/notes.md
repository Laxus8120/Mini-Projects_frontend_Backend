**line height - cal(1em + 0.5rem);**

Genrally the 1.5rem line-height loooks good but the problem is that when we increase the size of a font the line height become to much and feel odd, So, to make the line height correctly relative to font-size we use the above cal() method to make the ralative changes according to the font-size. `(0.5 rem is equal to 8px)`




img,picture,video,canvas,svg{
    display: block;
    
}

All these are inline so we are giving them a block display.
